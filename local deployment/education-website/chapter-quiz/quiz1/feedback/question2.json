The exact output of the code print(type(7)) will be <class 'int'>, indicating that 7 is an integer. Your explanation \"because ints are numbers\" is on the right track but could be more detailed. It’s important to clearly explain the role of the type() function in Python and differentiate between integers and floats. Here’s a more comprehensive explanation: The code print(type(7)) will output <class 'int'>. This is because 7 is an integer in Python, and the type() function is used to determine the type of an object. In this case, it confirms that 7 is of type int.
