Review each question, user's answer, and explanation. \n2. Determine if the user's answer and explanation are \"correct\" or \"incorrect\".\n3. If they did not put an answer mark the answer as \"incorrect\". \n4. If they did not put an explanation mark the explanation as \"Incorrect\"\n4. Summarize specific sections for the user to review based on incorrect answers.\n5. Format the output as follows:\n\n**Output Format:**\n\n- For each question:\n  - Display the question number.\n  - Indicate whether the user's answer is \"correct\" or \"incorrect\".\n  - Indicate whether the user's explanation is \"correct\" or \"incorrect\".\n\n- If there are any incorrect answers or explanations, list specific sections for the user to review. Otherwise, provide positive feedback for all correct answers.\n\n**Example Output:**\nQuestion 1 user answer: correct explanation: correct\nQuestion 2 user answer: incorrect explanation: incorrect\nQuestion 3 user answer: correct explanation: correct\n...\nSpecific Sections to Review:\nChapter 1: \n-Section 1.2\n-Section 1.3\nChapter 2: \n-Section 2.1\n-Section 2.2\n...\nIf all answers are correct, display: Specific Sections to Review: Great job!

This will help them understand how functions can be used to perform tasks such as generating personalized greetings using parameters.\r\n        If a student is familiar with functions but not with formatted output, they should review Chapter 2, Section 2.5. This section covers output operations, particularly how strings can be formatted and displayed, which is essential for tasks involving user interaction and display.\r\n        If a student needs to enhance understanding in both using functions effectively and managing output within those functions, studying both sections is advisable. Chapter 5, Section 5.2 will explain the specifics of writing functions that handle string data, and Chapter 2, Section 2.5 will demonstrate the practical application of these functions in formatted printing. \n- Question 23: \"7\" (Chapter 5, Section 5.2)\n- Question 24: \"24\" (Chapter 5, Section 5.10)\n- Question 25: \"8\" (Chapter 5, Section 5.3; Chapter 4, Section 4.2)\r\n    Reasoning:\r\n        If a student understands basic function definitions but is unclear about incorporating loops within functions, they should be directed to Chapter 4, Section 4.2, which focuses on using loops within functions. This will help them grasp how repeated operations, such as multiplying a number several times, can be managed efficiently within a function.\r\n        If a student is familiar with using loops but not with their application within functions, they should review Chapter 5, Section 5.3. This section covers how functions are structured and implemented, providing foundational knowledge that supports encapsulating loop operations within functions.\r\n        If a student needs to enhance understanding in both writing functions and integrating loops within those functions, studying both sections is advisable.
