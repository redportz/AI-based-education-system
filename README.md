# AI-Based Education System

## Description
This AI-based education system is designed to teach beginners Python through an interactive website. After an initial exam, the system uses AI to dynamically adjust quizzes and learning materials based on the student's performance. It provides personalized feedback on exams and homework, enhancing the learning experience. The AI can reword questions during the exam and also answer queries related to the content on the current page, providing additional examples if students struggle with specific concepts.

## Features
- Interactive Python tutorials.
- Adaptive learning that adjusts content based on student assessments.
- Real-time feedback and AI-driven support throughout the learning process.
- Ability to reword exam questions and homework assignments for clarity.
- A system for submitting and automatically grading assignments.

## Installation
Instructions on how to set up the project locally will be provided soon.

## Usage
To start, navigate to the homepage of the website (URL to be added). Here, you will find all the available chapters listed. You can start with the first chapter or click the "Start" button at the top left corner to begin.

### Assignments
The assignment section allows submissions either directly through a text box or by uploading a .txt file. The system will grade these submissions and offer feedback. Features like question rewording and query support are available to assist with assignments.

### Quizzes
Each quiz question comes with a "Reword" option to clarify the question if needed. Students are required to provide answers and explanations for their choices. The AI assesses these responses and determines whether the student should advance to the next section or receive additional examples on misunderstood concepts.

## Contributing
